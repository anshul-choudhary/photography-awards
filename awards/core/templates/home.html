    <p class="pb-30">When we organized this session in Paris with Agnes and Jonathan, Agnes who’s also wedding photographer, asked me if I could build a few images with slow shutter, like I did with bikers or peoples in the street on other pictures I shared on my blog. Since we were in Paris, I thought to the subway and she said me that there was a subway station who was more pretty than others. So we went in and I asked them to make hugs on the subway platform. Then I went on the other side of the railway and we waited for the train. I had prepared my camera and now I had to be on the good height to capture them trough the train’s windows… I shot several time with high cadence and when the subway stopped, I found this picture that I was glad to offer them.<br />

    <p class="pb-30">What a great day we had in February in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. It was a cold and windy day, but the skies were great. On the moment we took this picture the sun was there for only a couple of minutes.The love story of this wedding couple is very special. They have so many stories and memories about the relationship. One of their lovely stories is the proposal. The groom asked his bride on this spot on a very special way. Because this marriage was intimate and small with only their family, you feel the love every minute. Their love story will be continuing with so many new memories. I feel very special that I could capture this moment.</p>

    As soon as their lantern was almost ready to release I asked the couple to gently lean in for a kiss under the lantern, and whoa, that's the result I got was amazing, the background sky looked just like a painting to me and created such a romantic moment for the two of them, with the play of the light and shadow</p>

    <p class="pb-30">We had just finished our First Look photos with the bride and groom and were waiting for the ceremony. The bride was sitting in the shadows of the window and the groom was off in the distance and was holding the bride's bouquet.  I loved how the shadows of the giant window was playing off both of them creating this silhouette.  So I asked the groom to walk towards the bride and just do whatever came naturally – of course he kissed her.  I did not expect him to place the flowers behind his back, but it made the image perfect!</p>

    After sunset, we went out into an adjacent field and used an umbrella to keep relatively dry while my assistant placed the flash and we did a few test shots. We counted down from 5 and my assistant grabbed the umbrella from them as close to zero as possible.<br />
    We were soaked. Even the bride and groom.<br />

    <p class="pb-30">This wedding was filled with touching moments from start to finish, but this image holds a lot of sentiment for me. Just before the ceremony, the family waited in the changing room with the bride. Everything was hushed. Daniella stood right in front of this full-length mirror and didn't even think twice about fussing with her hair or makeup. Of course she looked radiant, but she spent those last few minutes before marriage focused on her family. Dad had just wished her good luck, and it was mom's turn. She and mom couldn't let each other go. They held hands. And following ancient Jewish tradition, mom blessed Daniella with a peaceful and everlasting happiness in marriage. Every wedding I shoot is memorable, but this moment is unforgettable.</p>

    They preferred just a short shoot in the dunes after the ceremony in a little church, first with their little toddler (how cute he was!) and then together. We had like 10 minutes to shoot and the light was magical. <br />
    The couple decided to go to the location of the shoot by Solex, with a double seat. Very special! On a little hill they stopped, and I was able to make this picture.</p>
